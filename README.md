# PythonGameFiles
These are two python game files I wrote during one of my intrductory programming courses in college.

The concept of the first batteship file is very simple. The battleship game is a 1-player game in which the user enters 5 sets of
x and y cooridnates to place their ships on the game board. The computer then uses a random generator to place their ships on the game 
board. The user and computer then both take turns, trying to find the other player's ships by guessing ordered pair coordinates on the 
command line. This project makes use of 2-d arrays to build the game board and try-catch blocks to manage bad input. 

The pluck and plant program was recently refactored for several reasons. Mainly, I wanted to fix redundancy issues in the code and create
more accurate variable and function names.

In the pluckand plant, game the objective is to move across a game board in one of the four cardinal directions. You must find the flower
which is planted on the game board and displayed as a  '*' character. Once the user finds the flower on the game board, they must then
return the flower another special position on the board called the return spot, which is display with a '$' character.
